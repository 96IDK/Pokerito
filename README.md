Pokerito - The Simplified Poker Game

Overview:
Pokerito is a text-based card game for two players (you and the computer) based on Poker, but with a simpler concept. The game's objective is to have the most matches between your initial card and the five drawn river cards.

How to Play:
1. Run the Java program (Pokerito.java) to start the game.
2. The dealer will explain the rules, and you'll be prompted to begin when ready.
3. Each player (you and the computer) will receive one random card from the deck.
4. The dealer will draw five more random cards, creating the "river."
5. Matches between each player's card and the river cards will be counted.
6. The player with the most matches wins the game. If matches are equal, it's a draw.
